# MSWindowsBackupManager
 Write a program that works as a Windows service (versions 7-10). The program should backup data from the specified directory. Requirements: - The program should not be interactive, all settings are set using a configuration file; - The program must create an archive with a backup of data from the specified directory; - Files to be included in the backup should be specified by mask (using *, ?) or directly by name; - The backup should be created as a ZIP archive; - When existing files are changed or new files appear in the source directory (corresponding to the specified mask), the backup archive is automatically updated with new data (or existing data is replaced); - Installation, uninstallation, start, stop from the command line (implementation of its own SCP); - Correct stopping and restarting of the service on request from SCM (processing of commands sent through the "Services" snap-in); - File and directory names are specified in UNC format. The configuration file must at a minimum contain: - The name of the directory from which the backup is being performed; - The name of the archive file and the directory where it should be located; - Masks/names of the files to be backed up.
